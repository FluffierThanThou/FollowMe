Gives the camera tracking capabilities. 

# Features
Press the 'Home' key (default, can be changed with in-game keybinding settings) while any colonist, enemy, animal or item is selected, and the camera will follow them (including furniture and plants - but they tend to not move much). Alternatively, you can right click colonists in the Colonist Bar on top of the screen to toggle following.

**Does not require a new save game**
Can safely be enabled/disabled in ongoing saves.
